* Lab 1

    Lab 1 is one of my favorite experiences because it was my first time coding. 
    The task was simple, but it meant a lot to me. I had no experience with programming, 
    so when I typed the code and saw "Hello World" show up on the terminal, I felt 
    a wave of joy. It was a small but significant achievement that sparked my curiosity 
    about technology and programming.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was one of my favorite labs because it introduced the use of make commands, 
    as "make lint." These commands have simplified the completion of the other 
    labs by making linting and running tests much easier. Additionally, this lab required 
    us to work with if statements and arithmetic operators, which I found enjoyable.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 was one of my favorite labs because of the use of if statements. 
    It was also enjoyable to calculate the area of a rectangle using functions. 
    It was rewarding to see how breaking down the problem into smaller parts made 
    the process clearer and more manageable.
